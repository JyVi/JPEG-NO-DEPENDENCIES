# JPEG-NO-DEPENDENCIES
I am recreating the JPEG algorithm using C++, my build system for this project will be CMake using Clangd.

This project is part of a continuity of my current study courses.
I took in my school an "Ã‰lectif", which are small side courses to direct us into choosing a suitable specialty for the next 2 years in EPITA Engineer cycle (ING2 and ING3).

I am experimenting with the CMake build system, which I used to build my projects during the C++ Piscine.
I will try to keep a clean build and structure for it.

I am going to try to rush it in 1 or 2 week (I hope so)




InstallDependencies.sh is an executable file for installing the relative 
dependencies of the project, especially the SDL2 dependencies and cmake
